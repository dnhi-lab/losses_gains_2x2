# losses_gains_2x2

This repository contains all data and code for all analyses report in this preprint:

Data collection
- For the iterated experiments, I uploaded the scripts used for Expeirment 3 of our preprint (https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/4me3h); the scripts for Experiments 1 and 2 are practically identical. '00_LT_in_PD_2' is the main script, from which the others follow. You can see sreenshots of the task in the instructions
- For the one-shot experiments, we uploaded the complete SoSciSurvey file for Experiment 7 (Experiments 4-6 are practically identical, but with fewer 2x2 games), and a Word document with screenshots and minor explanations of each page

Data analysis
- All analysis done in Matlab apart from the occasional figure, which was done in R
- Analysis_Exp_N is the main analysis file for Experiment N
